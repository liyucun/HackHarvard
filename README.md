What it does


This mobile app generates a playlist of songs based on the emotions captured in a photo. The emotions are identified using Microsoft’s Cognitive API, from which we leveraged their leading algorithms in emotion detection. Combined with a mobile device, your phone now becomes the “emotional” mobile jukebox!


How we built it


We built it using Java alongside with the Android SDK, Spotify’s SDK and powering the emotion detection is Microsoft’s Cognitive Emotion API. We also made use of third party libraries to assist us in generating features such as the Radar Graph that depicts the emotions detected by the Microsoft Cognitive API. 


Challenges we ran into


We ran into some troubles midway through after connecting Spotify and our application together, the issue was to do with prioritizing what to accomplish at first, and soon transitioned into more of a technical problem that involved the use of Microsoft Cognitive API. We initially had some issues with the transmission of data from the user to the API, but that got resolved quickly with the aid of the kind mentors at the Microsoft booth. After jumping over the hurdle, the bulk of the other issue was detecting and tracing the issues that the application faced.
